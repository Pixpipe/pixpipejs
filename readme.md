![Pixpipe.js](images/pixpipe256.png)

[Pixpipe.js](https://github.com/jonathanlurie/pixpipejs) is an attempt of building an image processing pipeline entirely in native Javascript for browsers. Its architecture was somewhat inspired by [ITK](https://itk.org/), making a clear distinction between objects that *contains* data (inherit from `PixpipeContainer`) from object that *processes* data (inherit from `Filter`).  

The concept of *pipeline* implies that the output of a `Filter` can be used as an input for the next one, like in *ITK*. In Pixpipe.js, this is done by using the `Filter`'s methods `addInput()` and `getOuput()`. Some `Filter` may have several *input* or *output* of different kinds.


# Motivations
To make image processing:
- accessible, using just a web browser and a textpad
- easy to use in a sense that "all filters work the same way".
- with no other dependency than `pixpipe.js`
- with no required compilation or system fuss
- modular
- generic enough to use different kind of data/datasource
- easy to contribute
- well documented for both users and contributors.

# Presentation
[Here](http://me.jonathanlurie.fr/slides/pixpipejs_01) are some slides to present Pixpipejs. Maybe an easier introduction.

# Cookbook
The best way to learn how to uses Pixpipe is by going through the [cookbook](cookbook/readme.md) (there is also [the web version](http://me.jonathanlurie.fr/pixpipejs/cookbook/)). You'll find in-depth descriptions of the core components, examples and how-to's.


# Documentation
This [documentation](http://me.jonathanlurie.fr/pixpipejs/doc/)  is autogenerated from source comments and thus is prety complete. Interested in how to generate your own? go [there](http://me.jonathanlurie.fr/pixpipejs/cookbook/#building-the-documentation).


# Compatible formats
Here is the list of compatible formats:
- jpeg (to Image2D)
- png (to Image2D)
- tiff (to Image2D)
- NIfTI (to Image3D / MniVolume)
- Minc2 (to Image3D / MniVolume)
- MGH/MHZ (to Image3D / MniVolume)
- Pixp (generic *Pixpipe* format for both Image2D and Image3D )


# The Pixp format
For saving intermediate or final results to a local storage, Pixpipe needs a file format. I wanted something generic enough to works with Image3D, Image2D and possible future formats without having to deal without having to deal with this or that specificity of this or that container. In other words, one single `save()` method and one single `open()` method, no matter the kind of data. This is possible thanks to the common features of `Image2D` and `Image3D` (they both inherit from `PixpipeContainer`). The format I've chosen for quite naive but very versatile: JSON, compressed with gzip (using [Pako](https://github.com/nodeca/pako)) The extension is `*.pixp`, here is the format description:

```javascript
// this is a 2D image
{
  // TypedArray type
  "dataType":"Float32Array",

  // 1D array of data
  "data":[
    255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255,255,128,64,255
  ],

  // metadata
  "metadata":{
    "ncpp":4,
    "width":10,
    "height":5
  },

  // Original Pixpipe type
  "pixpipeType":"Image2D"
}
```
- **TypedArray type** can be any typed array from here https://mzl.la/2nASpcK
- **1D array of data** in case of rgba image, the data are ordered *rgbargbargba...*
- **metadata** are usually different from Image2D and Image3D but always carry dimensionality and the number of components per pixel
- **Original Pixpipe type** to be able to reconstruct the original object

*Note:* JSON serialization does not play well with TypedArrays and interpret them as *Object* when parsing back, this is why we need to keep a track of the TypedArray type and need to convert the *data* into a regular *Array* (and not *TypedArray*).
